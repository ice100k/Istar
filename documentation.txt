VARIABLES:
  use  # to declare a variable. for example:
    # a = 5

  to use the variable just type in the name for example:
    # a = 5
    a + 2

    this example will return 7 because a is 5 and 5 + 2 is 7

MATH OPERATIONS:

  > Grater than
  < Less than
  >= Grater than or equals
  <= Less than or equals
  == equivalant
  + plus
  - minus
  * multiply
  / divide
  ^ power (for example 5^2 would return 25)

  NOTE: in your calculations you can use parenthisis. I* uses the standard order of operations: BIDMAS

IF/ELSE/ELIF statements:
  'if' condition 'then' code to execute 'elif' condition 'then' code to execute 'else' code to execute

  example if statement:
    if 5 == 6 then # a = 6 elif 5 > 6 then # a = 25 else # a = 6

    in this example a would be set equal to 6 because the previous conditons are not true

IF STATMENTS IN VARAIBLE ASSIGNMENTS
  you can use if statements in a variable assignment!

  example:
    # a = if 5 >= 5 then 40 else 20

    in this example a would be set to 40 because 5 is equal to 5
