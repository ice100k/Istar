# Istar
I* is a simple programming language made by ice100k. I* is a interpreted language built entirely on python

To be able to use I* you need some other programs installed:
you need JRE version 14
you also need python version 3.7

you need JRE in order to use the IDE

you need python 3.7 to use the language itself

The IDE is loacated in the ideApplication folder
In the idle ideApplication folder you will find different builds to fit your needs


In the I* folder is where you will find all the main stuff for I* like the files you need to setup a project and whatnot.
in Istar you will find the following files:

istar.py

shell.py

strings_with_arrows.py

sample.is


grammar.txt is a file explaining how I* works. it is not needed and dosen't actually mean or do anything.

istar.py and shell.py need to stay in the same directory. The only one that needs to be executed to run the program is shell.py. Istar.py just holds lots of classes to make shell.py run.

sample.is is a dummy file containing I* code.

The file extention for I* is .is
